With this program you can play three videos next to each other at the same time. It is optimized for portrait videos but can technically play landscape videos as well.

To begin, click the Start button and select the directory which contains the videos you want to play.
The player will collect all supported video files in the chosen directory, shuffle the list and then start playing them, three at a time.
If playback reaches the end of the list, the list is shuffled again and playback continues from the new start.

You can press F11 to enter fullscreen-mode.

Under File/Preferences you can set a default directory to be used when pressing the Start button while holding Ctrl.

Exit the program by pressing the ESC key.
