### How to use this application?
Each release includes the complete source code needed to build the app as well as precompiled binaries. To use the binaries simply extract them into the desired folder and run the executable.

To start playing videos, click the Start button and select the directory which contains the videos you want to play.
The player will collect all supported video files in the chosen directory, shuffle the list and then start playing them, three at a time.
If playback reaches the end of the list, the list is shuffled again and playback continues from the new start.

Under File/Preferences you can set a default directory to be used when pressing the Start button while holding Ctrl.

### Keyboard shortcuts
- Press F11 to enter or exit fullscreen-mode.
- Press 1, 2, or 3 to switch which videos audio is played.
- Scrolling the mousewheel on either video player changes the playback volume
- Pressing Alt+P opens the preferences dialog.
- Exit the program by pressing the ESC key or Alt+Q.
